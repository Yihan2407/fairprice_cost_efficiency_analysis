# Fairprice Protein Sources: A Cost- and Calorie-Efficiency Analysis

The Tableau Dashboard may be viewed [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lim.yi.han/viz/Cost-andCalorieEfficiencyofFairPriceProteinSources/Dashboard1)

The average serving of whey protein contains about 25g of protein. To build muscle, it is commonly recommended to consume a wide range of protein sources instead of only whey protein alone to ensure a well-balanced and nutritious diet. However, how cost- and calorie-efficient (let's abbreviate this as C&C efficiency) is whey protein compared to common protein sources that we may consume within a week? To examine this, I performed a simple study that compares the C&C efficiency of popular Fairprice protein sources to a single serving of whey protein. As a point of reference, I used the Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Whey Protein, that has 25g of protein and 121kcal per serving. To obtain the data, I scraped the prices and nutritional information of products falling under popular protein sources such as protein bars, dairy and nuts.
