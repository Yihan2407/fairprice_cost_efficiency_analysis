The average serving of whey protein contains about 25g of protein. To build muscle, it is commonly recommended to consume a wide range of protein sources instead of only whey protein alone to ensure a well-balanced and nutritious diet. However, how cost- and calorie-efficient (let's abbreviate this as C&C efficiency) is whey protein compared to common protein sources that we may consume within a week? To examine this, I performed a simple study that compares the C&C efficiency of popular Fairprice protein sources to a single serving of whey protein. As a point of reference, I used the Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Whey Protein, that has 25g of protein and 121kcal per serving. To obtain the data, I scraped the prices and nutritional information of products falling under popular protein sources such as protein bars, dairy and nuts.

From the simple study, it can be glimpsed that the most cost-efficient protein sources are oats, soy protein, meat (particularly chicken breast) and dairy. However, to consume the equivalence of 24g of protein, multiple servings of such protein sources needs to be consumed (except for meat of course) as opposed to the single serving of whey protein, which of course translates to a much greater caloric intake. While dairy is more expensive to consume than other categories such as oats, dairy sources often provide plenty of protein at a lower total caloric intake. Skinless chicken breast, which costs only S$1.47 to attain the equivalence of 24g of protein, comes out to about 128kcal which is the lowest by far. Even so, it is still unable to beat the calorie efficiency of whey protein, which sits at about 121kcal per serving. Surprisingly, the Quest Nutrition bar offerings, while sitting at the more expensive price range of about S$10.27 to attain the equivalence of 24g of protein, actually comes out to about 216kcal placing it as the second most calorie efficient protein source (with the first being skinless chicken breast) making it a rather solid choice as a quick protein snack. It is also noted that while most oats found were relatively cheap to consume, for example the Quaker 100% Wholegrain Oatmeal that sits at about $1.17 per 24g of protein making it cheaper than whey protein, actually comes out to about a whopping total of 720kcal or 5.58 servings of 35g each to consume a total of 24g protein. In conclusion, whey protein is undeniably a cost- and calorie efficient protein source that is hard to beat, though it of course lacks the vital nutritions required to form a well-balanced diet if taken alone.
